        "About"                     : "Passionate, dynamic and a graduate of a Master in computer methods applied to business management at the University of Paris 1 - Panthéon-Sorbonne, I have been interested for many years in new technologies. I particularly like the idea that the applications I design make everyday life easier for users. It is with this in mind that I have developed, for D-Dale, a solution for orientation in complex buildings that is totally independent of any physical equipment or Internet connection.",

Feel free to discover <a class='highlight' href='/projects'>my different projects</a>, consult <a class='highlight' href={cv_url}>my resume</a> or <a class='highlight' href='/contact'>contact me</a> directly if you want to learn more about my work."
